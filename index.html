 <h3> From SAHM To Coding Career</h3>
  <p>Thank you for visiting my site. First a little about me. For the past 8 years I have been a Stay At Home Mom, caring for my daughter as well as helping my husband
   with his construction business in the bookkeeping department. Before that I was a waitress and a Horse Trainer. I have been working jobs since the ripe old age of 10
   and have devloped a varitey of skills. Recently I decided to look up coding as it interested me and I wanted to learn more about computers. I have been throughly 
   enjoying it and hope to continue for years to come.</p>
